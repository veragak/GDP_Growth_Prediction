## Project Description
This project predicts GDP growth across countries using multiple linear regression and penalized regression techniques (LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net) with R. It explores key economic, demographic, and institutional factors to identify drivers of growth. Both continuous and binary (high-growth) outcomes are analyzed.

## Folder Structure
- `data` – Original dataset used for analysis  
- `scripts` – R scripts separated by analysis steps  
- `report` – RMarkdown file and generated PDF report  
- `output` – Graphs and model outputs (optional for upload)  

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. OLS regression with stepwise selection  
3. LASSO regression for variable selection  
4. Ridge and Elastic Net for regularization  
5. Logistic regression for high-growth classification  
6. Model evaluation using RMSE, ROC, and AUC  

## Notes
- This was a group assignment completed in class  
- Data files are included in `data`  
- Scripts are modular for clarity and reproducibility
